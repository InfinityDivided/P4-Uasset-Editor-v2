2.2
- Added partial support for blueprint generated class files (files that start with "G"). 
  Files in these directories are officially supported, but others may work too:
-- Carrot4/Content/Carrot4/Placeables/Teki
-- Carrot4/Content/Carrot4/Placeables/Pikmin
-- Carrot4/Content/Carrot4/Placeables/Objects/Otakara

- Fix: Files which contain a name associated to two different classes are no longer encoded incorrectly.
- Fix: Vector structs inside arrays (the ones with the elements "X", "Y", "Z") are now encoded correctly.


2.1
- Added support for data tables (files that start with "DT")
- Added support for imports from the global.ucas file
- Slightly restructured the editable .json output to accomodate data tables, files decoded in 2.0 will have to be decoded again


2.0 - Completely rewrote the tool. It supports arbitrary changes to the data structure now, but is limited to editing "ActorPlacementInfoAsset" type assets.
